|Manual.2=It's a warning, and fired once if a specific label value could't be read.  
|Manual.3=The values of labels are used to show them as text in the GUI. Please translate this label as soon as possible.
|Manual.4=During the software development process a number of annoying events "LabelNotDefined" might be fired, because new labels, designed by the developer, are not translated yet. In this case please switch off this event by setting the configuration parameter "NotifyLabelEvents" to "false".
|Usage.Header=Processing of labels at runtime
|Usage.1=All labels are read into the central memory in the course of starting the system. Once the application has to process a real request it reads the label identifier directly in the central memory.
|Usage.2=First the application tries to read the value of the main language. If the label item can't be found the application tries to read the value of the secondary language.
|Usage.3=If the label can't be found neither the application reads the value of the label resource itself as a fallback value. The resource value should be available generally because it is a fundamental part of the runtime environment of the system.
|Usage.4=If even the basic information isn't available, the "Group" and "Name" of the label identifier are shown on screen instead of the value of the label. The same procedure is applied if the value of the label is empty (not set).
